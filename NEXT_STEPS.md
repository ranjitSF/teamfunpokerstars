# 🎯 Next Steps for Your Poker Championship Tracker

Congratulations! Your elegant poker tracking app is ready. Here's what to do next:

## ✅ Immediate Tasks

### 1. Set Up Firebase (5 minutes)
- Create a Firebase project at https://console.firebase.google.com
- Enable Email/Password authentication
- Get your web config and service account credentials
- See `SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed steps

### 2. Set Up Database (5 minutes)
Choose one of these:
- **Supabase** (Recommended): https://supabase.com - Free tier, easy to use
- **Neon**: https://neon.tech - Serverless Postgres
- **Railway**: https://railway.app - Simple deployment

Run the schema from `server/database/schema.sql`

### 3. Configure Email (5 minutes)
- Use Gmail with app-specific password
- Or use SendGrid/Mailgun for production
- Test locally first!

### 4. Test Locally (10 minutes)
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your credentials in .env
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 and test:
- Sign up with your email
- Create a game
- Add results
- Check dashboard stats

### 5. Deploy to Vercel (10 minutes)
```bash
# Push to GitHub
git remote add origin <your-github-url>
git push -u origin main

# Then import to Vercel
# Add all environment variables
# Deploy!
```

## 📋 Customization Ideas

### Add Your Player List
Edit `server/routes/players.js` to add email whitelist:

```javascript
const AUTHORIZED_EMAILS = [
  'player1@example.com',
  'player2@example.com',
  'player3@example.com',
  // ... add all your players
];

// In the sync route, add validation
if (!AUTHORIZED_EMAILS.includes(email)) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Not authorized' });
}
```

### Customize Points System
Edit `server/utils/points.js` to change scoring:

```javascript
// Current: 100, 85, 70, 55, 40, 25, 15, 5 (for 8 players)
// You can modify the formula to suit your preferences
```

### Change Theme Colors
Edit `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
colors: {
  poker: {
    dark: '#0a0e1a',      // Background
    card: '#1a1f35',      // Card backgrounds
    accent: '#d4af37',    // Gold accent
    gold: '#ffd700',      // Bright gold
  },
}
```

### Add More Stats
The database views are extensible. Add to `schema.sql`:
- Longest winning streaks
- Best comeback stories
- Most improved player
- Monthly MVPs
